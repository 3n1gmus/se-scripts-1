MMaster's Configurable Automatic LCDs was rejected by Prior of the Ori, because repeated LCD updates 
apparently causes severe sim speed dips when all of the factions are running these updates on a number of their LCD panels.

Supposedly, there is a lot of overhead in the back end of sending updates to LCDs that involves performing operations on every
LCD each time an update is sent to a single LCD? 

The exact reason warrants investigation, but it is confirmed that this script
is causing obscure but severe performance problems.
