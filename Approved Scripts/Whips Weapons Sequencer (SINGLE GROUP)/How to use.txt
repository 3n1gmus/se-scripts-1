Whips weapons sequencer script!

This script will allow you to sequence your weapons, so that you can fire rockets or other cannons one after another rather than all at once.

IT IS CONFIRMED THAT THIS SCRIPT IS LAGGY WHEN USED ON LARGE CAPITAL SHIPS. DON'T DO IT. TRY TO KEEP THIS SCRIPT ONLY ON SMALL SHIPS.
WHIP IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A VERSION THAT WORKS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY, BUT WILL NOT LAG WHEN USED ON ANY TYPE OF SHIP.

Instructions:     
   
    1.) Create a timer. Assign the actions to the following:       
        * "trigger now" itself   
        * Run this program [NO ARGUMENTS YET!]     
    2.) Add the phrase "[Sequenced]" into the name of weapons u want to sequence (without quotes)    
    3.) Start the timer   
______________________________________________________________________________________          
Arguments:    
   
    Type in these arguments without quotes. These arguments can be input manually,   
    through timers, or through sensors. Letter case is unimportant. Seperate     
    multiple arguments with a semicolon (see examples further down)   
   
    "rate [integer]"      
        changes the rate of fire in rounds per second.    
        > [Maximum ROF] = [Standard ROF] * [Number of sequenced weapons]   
            NOTE: The script will round the ROF, this is not a bug!   
    "delay [integer]"     
        changes delay between shots to be in terms of frames (60 frames = 1 sec)      
    "default"      
        Lets the script to set the fire rate automatically based on the number of       
        available weapons. The script will attempt to fire ALL sequenced weapons in the   
        span of ONE second with this particular setting. The script will start in this    
        mode by default (hence the name :P)   
    "on"      
        Toggles fire on only      
    "off"     
        Toggles fire off only      
    "toggle"      
        Toggles fire on/off     
______________________________________________________________________________________       
Examples:   
   
    "on;default" will toggle the weapons on and use default rate of fire   
    "rate 10" will set the rate of fire to 10 rounds per second   
    "delay 3" will set the delay between weapons to 3 frames
