Instructions for Kankub's miner cargo script!
Kankub's miner cargo script will write cargo capacity information to LCD screens on your ship.


To set up the script for use, take the following steps.
1. Put a programmable block on the ship. 
	Put the script (by copying and pasting or otherwise) into the programmable block by pressing the "Edit" button in the control panel.
2. Put a timer block on your ship.
3. In the timer block's actions list, setup the actions so that from left to right...
	The script's Programmable block -> run -> set the argument to "cargo" without quotations
	The same timer block -> start
4. Set the timer block's timer to at least 5 seconds long

Now the script is ready to run. All you need to do now is make sure the timer is on, and press the "start" button on the timer block in the control panel.
To stop the script, you can either turn off the timer block, or press the "Stop" button on the timer block in the control panel.
Make sure to stop the script if you're not using the ship it belongs to! This will help (ever so slightly) with server performance.
Also make sure to stop the script if the ship is docked. Again, this will help with server performance.


If the script is writing to LCD screens that you don't want it to modify, you can make a quick and easy edit to the script to fix this.
The script searches for LCDs with the LCD_NAME value in it's name, so by changing LCD_NAME, you can target specific LCDs for cargo info.

Say you have an LCD screen with the name "LCD Panel (Cargo)" that you want to write to with cargo capacity info. 
To make the script recognize only this LCD screen, edit the following line in the script:
string LCD_NAME = "LCD"; 

and change it to
string LCD_NAME = "(Cargo)";
