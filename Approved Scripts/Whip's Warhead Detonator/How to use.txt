Whip's Warhead Detonator Script!

All this script does is arm then detonate all warheads on a grid.

First, place a programmable block on the grid with the warheads, and then place the script into it with the "Edit" button. Copy and Paste it in.

This can be used with a sensor or a timer, or even some other script.

To use it with a sensor: put a sensor on the same grid, and set up your sensor's detection parameters as usual (like detecting enemies and range and such)
When configuring actions with the sensor:
Left Action -> Programmable block (with this script) -> Run with Default Argument
Right Action - Leave this empty


To use it with a timer, like for a timed bomb: put a timer on the same grid, and set up the timer's delay as usual.
When configuring actions with the timer:
1st action (leftmost) -> Programmable block (with this script) -> Run with Default Argument
