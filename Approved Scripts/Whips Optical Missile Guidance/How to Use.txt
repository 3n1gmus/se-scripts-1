Whip's optical missile guidance!

This script lets you make guided torpedos that essentially aim in a straight line along the front of your ship (or along the aiming direction of a turret).
So if your ship is pointed at the enemy, the torpedo will fly towards the enemy!

It is confirmed that this script, even when on a timer that triggers itself, uses at most 1% of a server tick. 
This means that running this script uses, on average, less than 0.01 sim speed. And torpedos are generally short-lived anyhow.
