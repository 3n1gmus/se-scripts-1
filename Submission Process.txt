How the script submission process works:

Suggested scripts go into the suggested scripts folder
Here, everyone can see which scripts are suggested.
Suggested scripts MUST be well documented so that it is easy for people to install them and test them and use them.

The script moderators can then go through the suggested scripts, try them out, and discuss them.
Only scripts where moderators have reached a majority consensus should be approved.

If they are approved, then they will be moved into the approved scripts folder.
Otherwise, the script is moved into the rejected scripts folder, so it is easy to keep track of what has been thrown out.
